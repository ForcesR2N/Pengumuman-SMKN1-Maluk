## ðŸ“± Project Overview

This Flutter application was created to improve the student experience during graduation announcements at SMKN 1 Maluk. After receiving feedback from students about difficulties with the school's existing web interface, I developed this mobile solution with an enhanced UI/UX design to make the graduation announcement process more engaging and user-friendly.

### ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **Simple NISN Input**: Easy and intuitive interface for entering student ID numbers
- **Suspenseful Loading Animation**: Creates an exciting moment while checking results
- **Beautiful Results Display**: Clean presentation of graduation status and student information
- **Responsive Design**: Works across various Android devices
- **Error Handling**: Clear feedback when incorrect NISN is entered

## ðŸš€ Motivation

This project was born from hearing the frustrations of SMKN 1 Maluk students who were dissatisfied with the school's web-based announcement system. Many students complained about:

- Poor mobile responsiveness of the existing website
- Confusing user interface
- Slow loading times
- Lack of visual appeal during such an important moment

As someone passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, I took the initiative to develop a solution that transforms the graduation announcement experience into something more modern and enjoyable.
